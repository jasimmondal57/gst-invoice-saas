# B2B/B2C Customer Types Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented support for both B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Consumer) customer types in the GST Invoice Management SaaS platform.

### Key Achievement
**GST is now optional for customers** - Only B2B customers require GSTIN, while B2C customers can be created without it.
