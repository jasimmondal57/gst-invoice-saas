## What I've Done

### 1. Improved Frontend Logging
**File**: `frontend/app/dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx`

Added logging for:
- Token presence
- Organization ID
- Customer ID
- Items count
- Response status, type, URL
- Response body content
- Empty response detection

### 2. Improved Backend Error Handling
**File**: `backend/server.js`

Added:
- Better error handling middleware
- Unhandled promise rejection handler
- Uncaught exception handler
- Detailed error logging

### 3. Fixed Invoice Creation Logic
**File**: `backend/routes/invoices.js`

Already has:
- Amount field calculation
- Specific error messages
- Detailed logging

   - Description: Test
   - Quantity: 1
   - Unit: Nos
   - Rate: 1000

5. Click "Create Invoice"
6. **Watch the console for logs**

### Step 2: Share the Console Logs
Copy and share:
1. **All console logs** from the browser
2. **Backend terminal logs** (from the backend terminal)
3. **The error message** you see

### Step 3: I'll Analyze & Fix
With the logs, I can:
1. Identify the exact error
2. Fix the root cause
3. Test the fix
4. Verify it works
