# Complete B2B/B2C Implementation Summary ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented B2B/B2C customer types for the GST Invoice Management SaaS platform with full support for optional GSTIN based on customer type.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Added `CustomerType` enum (B2B, B2C)
- Added `SupplierType` enum (B2B, B2C)
- Added `InvoiceType` enum (B2B, B2C, EXPORT)
- Updated Customer model with `type` field
- Updated Supplier model with `type` field
- Updated Invoice model with `invoiceType` field
- Applied migration: `20251020210743_add_b2b_b2c_customer_types`

### 2. Backend API ✅
**Customer Routes** (`backend/routes/customers.js`)
- GSTIN validation: Required for B2B, optional for B2C
- Proper error messages for validation failures
- Automatic type handling

**Invoice Routes** (`backend/routes/invoices.js`)
- Automatic invoice type detection based on customer type
- Proper handling of B2B and B2C invoices
- Unit field support for invoice items

### 3. Frontend UI ✅

**Customer Management Page** (`frontend/app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx`)
- B2B/B2C radio button selector
- Conditional GSTIN field (only for B2B)
