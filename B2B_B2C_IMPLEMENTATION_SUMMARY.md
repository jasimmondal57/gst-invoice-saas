# B2B/B2C Customer Types Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented support for both B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Consumer) customer types in the GST Invoice Management SaaS platform. This allows users to manage customers with different tax requirements:
- **B2B Customers**: Require GSTIN (GST Identification Number) for business transactions
- **B2C Customers**: Don't require GSTIN for consumer transactions

## Database Changes

### 1. Updated Prisma Schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)

#### Added Enums:
```prisma
enum CustomerType {
  B2B
  B2C
}

enum SupplierType {
  B2B
  B2C
}

enum InvoiceType {
  B2B
  B2C
  EXPORT
}
```

#### Updated Models:
- **Customer Model**: Added `type` field (default: B2B) with index
- **Supplier Model**: Added `type` field (default: B2B) with index
- **Invoice Model**: Added `invoiceType` field (default: B2B) with index

### 2. Database Migration
Ran: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_b2b_b2c_customer_types`
- Migration file: `backend/prisma/migrations/20251020210743_add_b2b_b2c_customer_types/`
- Database is now in sync with updated schema

## Backend Changes

### 1. Customer Routes (`backend/routes/customers.js`)

**Updated POST /api/v1/customers endpoint:**
- Added validation to require GSTIN only for B2B customers
- For B2C customers, GSTIN is set to null
- Validates required fields: organizationId, name
- Returns detailed error messages

```javascript
// For B2B customers, GSTIN is required
if (type === 'B2B' && !gstin) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'GSTIN is required for B2B customers' });
}

// For B2C customers, GSTIN is set to null
gstin: type === 'B2C' ? null : gstin,
```

### 2. Invoice Routes (`backend/routes/invoices.js`)

**Updated POST /api/v1/invoices endpoint:**
- Fetches customer to determine invoice type
- Sets `invoiceType` based on customer type
- Automatically handles B2B and B2C invoices correctly

```javascript
// Get customer to determine invoice type
const customer = await prisma.customer.findUnique({
  where: { id: customerId }
});

// Set invoice type based on customer type
invoiceType: customer.type,
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Customer Management Page (`frontend/app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx`)

**Updated Customer Interface:**
- Added `type: 'B2B' | 'B2C'` field
- Made `gstin` optional
- Added `city` field

**Form Updates:**
- Added radio button selector for B2B/B2C customer type
- GSTIN field is now conditional - only shows for B2B customers
- Updated validation to require GSTIN only for B2B customers
- Added city field to customer form

**Customer Display:**
- Shows customer type badge (blue for B2B, green for B2C)
- Displays GSTIN only if available
- Shows city, state, and address information

### 2. Invoice Creation Page (`frontend/app/dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx`)

**Updated Customer Interface:**
- Added `type: 'B2B' | 'B2C'` field
- Made `gstin` optional
- Added `city` field

**Form Updates:**
- Added `customerType` field to track selected customer type
- Added `customerCity` field
- Updated customer selection to populate customer type

**Customer Selection Dropdown:**
- Shows customer type badge in dropdown
- Displays B2B/B2C indicator for each customer

**Conditional GSTIN Field:**
- GSTIN field only displays for B2B customers
- Hidden for B2C customers
- City field added to customer details section

**Customer Type Display:**
- Shows customer type badge in the "To (Customer)" section
- Updates dynamically when customer is selected

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Type Detection
- When a customer is selected in invoice creation, the invoice type is automatically set based on customer type
- No manual selection needed

### 2. Validation Logic
- **B2B Customers**: GSTIN is mandatory
- **B2C Customers**: GSTIN is optional/not required
- Backend validates and enforces these rules

### 3. User Interface
- Clear visual distinction between B2B and B2C customers
- Color-coded badges (blue for B2B, green for B2C)
- Conditional form fields based on customer type
- Improved UX with smart field visibility

### 4. Data Integrity
- Database enforces type field with enum values
- Backend validates GSTIN requirements
- Frontend prevents invalid data submission

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a B2B customer with GSTIN
- [ ] Create a B2C customer without GSTIN
- [ ] Try creating B2B customer without GSTIN (should fail)
- [ ] Create invoice with B2B customer (GSTIN field visible)
- [ ] Create invoice with B2C customer (GSTIN field hidden)
- [ ] Verify invoice type is set correctly based on customer type
- [ ] Check customer list displays type badges correctly
- [ ] Verify customer dropdown shows type indicators

## Files Modified

1. `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added enums and type fields
2. `backend/routes/customers.js` - Added validation logic
3. `backend/routes/invoices.js` - Added invoice type detection
4. `frontend/app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx` - Added type selector and conditional fields
5. `frontend/app/dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx` - Added type display and conditional GSTIN

## Migration Notes

- Existing customers default to B2B type
- Existing invoices default to B2B type
- No data loss during migration
- All existing functionality preserved

## Next Steps

1. Test B2B/B2C functionality thoroughly
2. Update E-Invoice generation to handle B2C invoices (no IRN required)
3. Update GST reports to filter by invoice type
4. Add B2C invoice template (without GSTIN)
5. Implement B2C-specific features (e.g., simplified invoices)
