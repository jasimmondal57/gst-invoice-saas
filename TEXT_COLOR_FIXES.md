# ✅ Text Color Visibility Fixes

## Issue Fixed
Text under boxes was not visible due to low contrast (white text on white background or gray-600 text on white background).

## Solution Applied
Changed all text colors from `text-gray-600` to `text-gray-700` or `text-gray-800` for better contrast and visibility.
