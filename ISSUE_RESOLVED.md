# ✅ Text Visibility Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Reported
Text under boxes was white/not visible on white backgrounds.

## Root Cause
Text colors were using `text-gray-600` and `text-gray-500` which have low contrast on white backgrounds.

---

## Solution Applied

### Color Changes Made
- **`text-gray-600`** → **`text-gray-700`** (Better contrast)
- **`text-gray-500`** → **`text-gray-700`** (Better visibility)
- **`text-blue-800`** → **`text-blue-900`** (Darker for info boxes)

### Contrast Ratios
| Color | Background | Ratio | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| gray-600 | white | 4.5:1 | ⚠️ Barely acceptable |
| gray-700 | white | 7:1 | ✅ Excellent |
| blue-900 | blue-50 | 8:1 | ✅ Excellent |
