# Ready to Build - Action Items

## Summary

Your GST Invoice SaaS platform is **80% complete**. The backend is fully functional with all APIs ready. You just need the frontend pages for:

1. **Products** - Create/List/Edit/Delete products
2. **Purchases** - Create/List purchase invoices
3. **Suppliers** - Create/List suppliers
4. **Inventory** - Track stock levels
5. **Reports** - View sales, purchase, and stock reports

## What's Working ✅

- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Organization setup
- ✅ Sales invoices (B2B/B2C)
- ✅ Customer management
- ✅ Navigation layout
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Database with all models

## What's Missing ❌

- ❌ Products page
- ❌ Purchase invoices page
- ❌ Suppliers page
- ❌ Inventory page
- ❌ Reports pages

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Step 2: Verify Frontend is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# Should return HTML
```

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
- Press F12 to open DevTools
- Go to Console tab
- Should see no errors

### Step 4: Test Existing Features
1. Go to `/dashboard/customers`
2. Create a B2B customer with GSTIN
3. Create a B2C customer without GSTIN
4. Go to `/dashboard/invoices/create`
5. Create an invoice with B2B customer
6. Check browser console for detailed logs
