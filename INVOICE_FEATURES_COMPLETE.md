## üêõ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Empty Error Response
**Problem**: Invoice creation failed with empty error object `{}`
**Root Cause**: Frontend sending unknown fields (`hsnCode`, `discount`, `discountType`)
**Solution**: Backend now filters out unknown fields before Prisma validation

### Issue 2: Missing Product Selection
**Problem**: No way to select products when creating invoices
**Solution**: Added product dropdown with search and auto-fill functionality

### Issue 3: Missing View/Edit Pages
**Problem**: No pages to view or edit invoice details
**Solution**: Created view page (`[id]/page.tsx`) and edit page (`[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

### Issue 4: Customer Name Not Displaying
**Problem**: Invoice list showed undefined customer names
**Solution**: Updated frontend to use `customer.name` from API response
